# The Lost City of Alexandra

## Introduction
Welcome to *The Lost City of Alexandra*. This project simulates a virtual escape room present in a hypothetical, abandoned city of the ancient world. In this game, the main character and his/her friends try to escape from a haunted house. There are various rooms, each containing numerous clues and one correct code to exit the room safely. The characters navigate their way out of the haunted house by navigating through these rooms. The entire project has been created using React.
